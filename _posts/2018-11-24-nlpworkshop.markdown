You not only get a chance to share what you know but also interact and widen your horizon. As an author, any opportunity to interact with the audience is really powerful. It gives me a chance to analyze and introspect what connects and where I need to work more.

I got a similar opportunity to work towards preparing and presenting a workshop on Natural Language Processing at the Data Hack Summit 2018. Data Hack is one of the well known conferences in India. Organized by Analytics Vidya, the quality of audience and presenters is top notch. The following is a quick abstract around the workshop we conducted:
+ Learn and understand popular NLP workflows with interactive examples
+ Covers concepts and interactive projects on cleaning and handling noisy unstructured text data including duplicate checks, spelling corrections and text wrangling
+ Build your own POS and NER taggers and parse text data to understand it better
+ Understand, build and explore text semantics and representations with traditional statistical models and newer word embedding models
+ Projects on popular NLP tasks including text classification, sentiment analysis, text clustering, summarization, topic models and recommendations
+ Brief coverage of the promise of deep learning for NLP
