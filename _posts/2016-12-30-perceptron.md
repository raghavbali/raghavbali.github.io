The meaning of the word **perceptron** as per the English dictionary is "a computer model or computerized machine devised to represent or simulate the ability of the brain to recognize and discriminate". This definition holds pretty true even when we talk in the context of Machine Learning. A Perceptron is a _Supervised Classification_ algorithm.

The algorithm is very true to its dictionary meaning and its origins are rather interesting as well.
Its origins date back to the 1950s and it was one the first ever _Neural Networks_ to be implemented. In a sense, the Perceptron learning algorithm is the fore-father of modern day Neural and Deep Learning Networks.



A Perceptron is a very simple yet elegant algorithm which is proven to work given the data meets its required constraints of linear separability. Invented and developed by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957, Perceptrons showcased the ability to classify images. The algorithm raised may eyebrows and interest alike. Further research and experimentation led to its proof of convergance along with identification of its limitations. See (Minsky and Papert's book)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptrons_\(book\)])

This algorithm also carries a sort of special meaning for me personally as well. Having read and heard fantastic stuff about the advancements in Machine Learning and Data Science along with being a sci-fi buff, I was quite intrigued by this field of computer science. Perceptron happens to be the very first learning algorithm we discussed and implemented as part of our course Machine Learning 101 at IIIT-Bangalore. The following is a snapshot of my class notes (you may overlook the handwriting please). #nostalgia

## The Classic Perceptron

A Perceptron is a Supervised Linear Classification Algorithm. In its most basic and classic sense, it is a binary classifier which is proven to converge and find a classifier for linearly separable dataset.
